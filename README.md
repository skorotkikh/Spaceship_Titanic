# Spaceship Titanic: EDA + Random Forest Classifier

In this project, I performed the Exploratory Data Analysis with the datasets taken from [kaggle.com](kaggle.com), the competition called [Spaceship Titanic](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/overview). I explored the variables, cleaned the data and tried to predict the values for the test dataset.

The code can be found in the **.ipynb** file. Enjoy!
